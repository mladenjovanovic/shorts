**{shorts}** is an R package aimed for the analysis of the un-resisted and resisted short sprints (<6sec; without deceleration), creation of *acceleration-velocity profiles* (AVP), *force-velocity profiles* (FVP), and *optimization profiles* using variety of sprint traces (e.g., time-velocity from laser/radar gun, distance-time from timing gates/photocells). It represents a simple to use tool for researcher and practitioners interested in modeling short sprints performance. 

## Installation

``` r
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("shorts")

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mladenjovanovic/shorts")
```

## Examples

**{shorts}** comes with multiple sample data sets. Let's load `split_times` and `radar_gun_data` with N=5 athletes:

```{r example}
library(shorts)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

data("split_times", "radar_gun_data")
```

### Profiling using split times 

**{shorts}** package utilizes modified *mono-exponential functions* to model short sprint performance. To model sprint performance using split times, distance will be used as predictor and time as target. Since `split_times` dataset contains data for multiple athletes, let's extract only one athlete and model it using `shorts::model_timing_gates()` function. 

```{r}
kimberley_data <- filter(split_times, athlete == "Kimberley")

kable(kimberley_data)
```

Parameters estimated using mono-exponential equation are *maximal sprinting speed* ($MSS$), and *maximal acceleration* (MAC). Additional parameters computed from $MSS$ and $MAC$ are *relative acceleration* ($TAU$) and *maximal relative power* ($PMAX$) (which is calculated as $MAC \cdot MSS\div4$). 

```{r}
kimberley_profile <- shorts::model_timing_gates(
  distance = kimberley_data$distance,
  time = kimberley_data$time
)

kimberley_profile

summary(kimberley_profile)

coef(kimberley_profile)

confint(kimberley_profile, level = 0.95)
```

To return the predicted/fitted values (in this case time variable), use `predict()` function: 

```{r}
predict(kimberley_profile)
```

To create a simple plot use S3 `plot()` method. There are four type options: `"model"` (default), `"kinematics-time"`, `"kinematics-distance"`, or `"residuals"`:

```{r}
plot(kimberley_profile)
```

```{r}
plot(kimberley_profile, "kinematics-time")
```

```{r}
plot(kimberley_profile, "kinematics-distance")
```

```{r}
plot(kimberley_profile, "residuals")
```

If you are interested in calculating average split velocity, use `shorts::format_splits()`

```{r}
kable(shorts::format_splits(
  distance = kimberley_data$distance,
  time = kimberley_data$time
))
```

To plot predicted velocity, acceleration, air resistance, force, and power over distance, use `shorts:predict_XXX()`. Please note that to calculate force, air resistance, and power, we need Kimberley's bodymass and height (as well as other characteristics such as air pressure, temperature and wind - see `get_air_resistance()` function).

```{r}
kimberley_bodymass <- 60 # in kilograms
kimberley_bodyheight <- 1.7 # in meters

kimberley_pred <- tibble(
  distance = seq(0, 40, length.out = 1000),

  # Velocity
  pred_velocity = shorts::predict_velocity_at_distance(
    distance,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$TAU
  ),

  # Acceleration
  pred_acceleration = shorts::predict_acceleration_at_distance(
    distance,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$TAU
  ),

  # Air resistance
  pred_air_resistance = shorts::predict_air_resistance_at_distance(
    distance,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$TAU,
    bodymass = kimberley_bodymass,
    bodyheight = kimberley_bodyheight
  ),

  # Force
  pred_force = shorts::predict_force_at_distance(
    distance,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$TAU,
    bodymass = kimberley_bodymass,
    bodyheight = kimberley_bodyheight
  ),

  # Power
  pred_power = shorts::predict_power_at_distance(
    distance,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
    kimberley_profile$parameters$TAU,
    bodymass = kimberley_bodymass,
    bodyheight = kimberley_bodyheight
  ),
)

# Convert to long
kimberley_pred <- gather(kimberley_pred, "metric", "value", -distance)

ggplot(kimberley_pred, aes(x = distance, y = value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~metric, scales = "free_y") +
  xlab("Distance (m)") +
  ylab(NULL)
```

To do prediction simpler, use `shorts::predict_kinematics()` function. This will provide kinetics and kinematics for 0-6 $s$ sprint using 100 $Hz$. 

```{r}
predicted_kinematics <- predict_kinematics(
  kimberley_profile,
  bodymass = kimberley_bodymass,
  bodyheight = kimberley_bodyheight
)

kable(head(predicted_kinematics))
```

To get model residuals, use `residuals()` function:

```{r}
residuals(kimberley_profile)
```

Package **{shorts}** comes with `find_XXX()` family of functions that allow finding peak power and it's location, as well as *critical distance* over which velocity, acceleration, or power drops below certain threshold:

```{r}
# Peak power and location
shorts::find_peak_power_distance(
  MSS = kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
  MAC = kimberley_profile$parameters$MAC, 
  bodymass = kimberley_bodymass,
  bodyheight = kimberley_bodyheight
)

# Distance over which power is over 80%
shorts::find_power_critical_distance(
  MSS = kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
  MAC = kimberley_profile$parameters$MAC, 
  bodymass = kimberley_bodymass,
  bodyheight = kimberley_bodyheight,
  percent = 0.8
)

# Distance over which acceleration is under 50%
shorts::find_acceleration_critical_distance(
  MSS = kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
  MAC = kimberley_profile$parameters$MAC,
  percent = 0.5
)

# Distance over which velocity is over 95%
shorts::find_velocity_critical_distance(
  MSS = kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
  MAC = kimberley_profile$parameters$MAC,
  percent = 0.95
)
```

### Profiling using radar gun data

The radar gun data is modeled using measured velocity as target variable and time as predictor. Individual analysis is performed using `shorts::model_radar_gun()` function or `shorts::model_laser_gun()` (they are aliases). Let's do analysis for Jim:

```{r}
jim_data <- filter(radar_gun_data, athlete == "Jim")

jim_profile <- shorts::model_radar_gun(
  time = jim_data$time,
  velocity = jim_data$velocity
)

jim_profile

summary(jim_profile)

confint(jim_profile)

plot(jim_profile)
```

In addition to $MSS$ and $MAC$ parameters, `shorts::model_radar_gun()` function also estimated *time-correction* ($TC$) parameter. 

Rather than estimating $MSS$, `shorts::model_radar_gun()` function allows you to utilize peak velocity observed in the data as $MSS$. This is done by setting the `use_observed_MSS` parameter to `TRUE`:

```{r}
jim_profile <- shorts::model_radar_gun(
  time = jim_data$time,
  velocity = jim_data$velocity,
  use_observed_MSS = TRUE
)

jim_profile

summary(jim_profile)
```

### Profiling using tether devices

Some tether devices provide data out in a velocity-at-distance format. In this case, velocity is the outcome variable and distance is the predictor. To estimate sprint profiles from *tether data*, use `shorts::model_tether()` function. 

```{r}
# This creates sprint trace
tether_df <- shorts::create_sprint_trace(
  MSS = 7, MAC = 6,
  time = seq(0.01, 6, by = 0.01))

m1 <- model_tether(
  distance = tether_df$distance,
  velocity = tether_df$velocity)

m1

plot(m1)
```

Setting `use_observed_MSS` parameter to `TRUE` in the `shorts::model_tether()` function also allows you to use observed *peak velocity* as $MSS$. 

In the case when distance is not centered at zero, use `shorts::model_tether_DC()` which also estimated the *distance correction* ($DC$) parameter, serving as model intercept (for more info see [Using corrections] section):

```{r}
# This creates sprint trace
tether_df <- shorts::create_sprint_trace(
  MSS = 7, MAC = 6,
  time = seq(0.001, 6, by = 0.01), 
  # Add distance shift
  DC = 5)

m1 <- model_tether_DC(
  distance = tether_df$distance,
  velocity = tether_df$velocity)

m1

plot(m1)
```

### Embedded (i.e., *in-situ*) Profiling

With the modern technologies like GPS and LPS, session acceleration and velocity can be tracked continuously. This provides an opportunity to estimate short sprint profiles from *in-situ*, without the need for explicit testing (assuming the maximal effort was performed). The analysis is based on the theoretical model where acceleration and velocity have linear relationship (i.e., mono-exponential model applied thus far). The time frame of the analysis can vary from single drills (e.g., sprint drills), session, week, to multiple weeks.

Here is an example of the data collected during one basketball session for a single person. Duration was approx. 90 min with 20 $Hz$ sampling rate. This is the positional data:

```{r}
data("LPS_session")

LPS_session %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

The next figure plots instant acceleration and velocity:

```{r}
LPS_session %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = velocity, y = acceleration)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

To estimate embedded short sprint profile, we need to filter out positive acceleration and velocities over 3 $ms{-1}$ (default), then filter few top acceleration observations per velocity bracket (for more information please see Clavel *et al.* (2023)). Here is the graphical representation:

```{r}
embedded_model <- model_in_situ(
  LPS_session$velocity,
  LPS_session$acceleration,
  velocity_threshold = 4)
                                
LPS_session %>%
  filter(acceleration > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = velocity, y = acceleration)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_point(
    data = embedded_model$data, 
    color = "red"
  ) +
  geom_abline(
    intercept = embedded_model$parameters$MAC,
    slope = -embedded_model$parameters$MAC / embedded_model$parameters$MSS,
    linetype = "dotted", color = "red") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, embedded_model$parameters$MSS)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, embedded_model$parameters$MAC))
```

### Force-Velocity Profiling

To estimate *Force-Velocity Profile* (FVP) using approach by Samozino *et al.* (2016, 2022) use `shorts::create_FVP()`:

```{r}
kimberley_fv <- shorts::create_FVP(
  MSS = kimberley_profile$parameters$MSS,
  MAC = kimberley_profile$parameters$MAC,
  # These are needed to estimate air resistance
  bodymass = kimberley_bodymass,
  bodyheight = kimberley_bodyheight
)

kimberley_fv
```

To convert back to *Acceleration-Velocity Profile* (AVP), use:

```{r}
kimberley_avp <- shorts::convert_FVP(
  F0 = kimberley_fv$F0,
  V0 = kimberley_fv$V0,
  bodymass = kimberley_bodymass,
  bodyheight = kimberley_bodyheight
)

kimberley_avp
```

#### Using external load

**{shorts}** package also allows utilizing external load in estimating FVP, as well as using FVP parameters to predict kinematic and kinetic variables. External load is represented either with additional **inertia** (i.e., weight vest), horizontal **resistance** (i.e., tether device that create additional resistance or help, or a hill sprinting), or both (i.e., a sled, which have both inertia and resistance due to friction forces). One might also consider head and tail wind as a form of resistance (or assistance).

Let's see how theoretical model, assuming FVP is *determinant of performance* (which I do not agree with, BTW), predicts changes in sprint characteristics (i.e., $MSS$ and $MAC$) under different external load conditions and magnitudes using Kimberley's estimated FVP:

```{r}
loads_df <- rbind(
  tibble(type = "Weight vest", magnitude = seq(0, 20, length.out = 100), inertia = magnitude, resistance = 0),
  tibble(type = "Tether", magnitude = seq(-50, 200, length.out = 100), inertia = 0, resistance = magnitude),
  tibble(type = "Sled", magnitude = seq(0, 40, length.out = 100), inertia = magnitude, resistance = magnitude * 9.81 * 0.4)
) %>%
  mutate(
    data.frame(shorts::convert_FVP(
      F0 = kimberley_fv$F0,
      V0 = kimberley_fv$V0,
      bodymass = kimberley_bodymass,
      bodyheight = kimberley_bodyheight,
      inertia = inertia,
      resistance = resistance
    ))
  ) 

loads_df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(MSS, MAC), names_to = "parameter") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = magnitude, y = value, color = parameter)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~type, scales = "free_x") +
  ylab(NULL)
```

Following figure depicts the effect on split times under different load types and magnitudes, assuming FVP to be determinant of performance (i.e., causal mechanism):

```{r}
dist_df <- expand_grid(
  loads_df,
  distance = c(5, 10, 20, 30, 40)
) %>%
  mutate(
    time = predict_time_at_distance(distance, MSS, MAC),
    distance = factor(
      paste0(distance, "m"), levels = c("5m", "10m", "20m", "30m", "40m"))
  ) 

dist_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = magnitude, y = time, color = distance)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~type, scales = "free_x") +
  ylab("Time (s)")
```

One can use external resistance when predicting force or power:

```{r}
shorts::predict_force_at_time(
  time = 0.5,
  MSS = 9,
  MAC = 7,
  bodymass = 75,
  inertia = 20,
  resistance = 50)

shorts::predict_power_at_time(
  time = 0.5,
  MSS = 9,
  MAC = 7,
  bodymass = 75,
  inertia = 20,
  resistance = 50)

shorts::predict_time_at_distance_FV(
  distance = 10,
  F0 = 750,
  V0 = 8,
  bodymass = 75,
  inertia = 20,
  resistance = 50)
```

External resistances can also be utilized in the [Optimization] functions, covered later. 

### Using corrections

You have probably noticed that estimated $MSS$ and $TAU$ were a bit too high for splits data. Biased estimates are due to differences in starting positions and *timing triggering methods* for certain measurement approaches (e.g. starting behind first timing gate, or allowing for body rocking). 

Here I will provide quick summary (see more in Jovanović M., 2023). Often, this bias in estimates is dealt with by using heuristic rule of thumb of adding time correction (`time_correction`) to split times (e.g. from 0.3-0.5 $sec$; see more in Haugen *et al.*, 2012). To do this, just add time correction to time split: 

```{r}
kimberley_profile_fixed_TC <- shorts::model_timing_gates(
  distance = kimberley_data$distance,
  time = kimberley_data$time + 0.3
)

kimberley_profile_fixed_TC

summary(kimberley_profile_fixed_TC)

coef(kimberley_profile_fixed_TC)
```

Instead of providing for `TC`, this parameter can be estimated using `shorts::model_timing_gates_TC()`.

```{r}
kimberley_profile_TC <- shorts::model_timing_gates_TC(
  distance = kimberley_data$distance,
  time = kimberley_data$time
)

kimberley_profile_TC
```

Instead of estimating `TC`, **{shorts}** package features a method of estimating flying start distance (`FD`):

```{r}
kimberley_profile_FD <- shorts::model_timing_gates_FD(
  distance = kimberley_data$distance,
  time = kimberley_data$time
)

kimberley_profile_FD
```

If you want to use fixed `FD` parameter (e.g., when you know what is the flying distance), use `shorts::model_timing_gates_FD_fixed()` function:

```{r}
kimberley_profile_fixed_FD <- shorts::model_timing_gates_FD_fixed(
  distance = kimberley_data$distance,
  time = kimberley_data$time,
  FD = 0.5
)

kimberley_profile_fixed_FD
```

There are other corrections involving time correction (`TC`), distance correction (`DC`), flying distance correction (`FD`), and time and distance corrections (`TC+DC`). They are implemented in the `model_timing_gates_` and `model_time_distance_` functions. The difference between the `model_timing_gates_` and `model_time_distance_` is in reversing predictor and outcome variables.

### Cross-Validation (CV)

`model_` family of functions come with CV feature that is performed by setting the function parameter CV to desired number of folds. This feature is very useful for checking model parameters robustness and model predictions on unseen data. Let's use Kimberley again, but this time perform special kind of CV, leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV):

```{r}
kimberley_profile_CV <- shorts::model_timing_gates(
  distance = kimberley_data$distance,
  time = kimberley_data$time,
  # To perform LOOCV number of folds is equal to 
  # number of observations
  CV = nrow(kimberley_data)
)

kimberley_profile_CV
```

Radar gun data often comes with much more observations, thus we can set smaller CV parameter:

```{r}
jim_profile_CV <- shorts::model_radar_gun(
  time = jim_data$time,
  velocity = jim_data$velocity,
  CV = 10
)

jim_profile_CV
```

### Optimization

Using the method outlined in Samozino *et al* (2022), one can find the optimal profiles, as well as the profile imbalance (compared to the optimal), for both sprint profiles (i.e., $MSS$ and $MAC$) and Force-Velocity (FV). In addition to this, one can *probe* the profiles (i.e., increase $V0$ / $F0$ or $MSS$ / $MAC$ for say 2.5% to check which improvement yield more improvement in sprint time). The following graph depicts estimate profile imbalances. Note that >100% is velocity deficit (i.e., increasing *velocity*; $MSS$ or $V0$; will yield more improvement in sprint times), while <100% is *force* deficit. 

```{r}
MSS <- 10
MAC <- 8
bodymass <- 75

fv <- create_FVP(MSS, MAC, bodymass)

opt_df <- tibble(
  dist = seq(5, 50, by = 5)
) %>%
  mutate(
    `Sprint Profile` = optimal_MSS_MAC(
      distance = dist,
      MSS,
      MAC
    )[["profile_imb"]],
    `FV Profile` = optimal_FV(
      distance = dist,
      fv$F0,
      fv$V0,
      bodymass
    )[["profile_imb"]],
    `FV Profile (PeakPower)` = optimal_FV(
      distance = dist,
      fv$F0,
      fv$V0,
      bodymass,
      method = "peak"
    )[["profile_imb"]],
    `Probe FV` = probe_FV(
      distance = dist,
      fv$F0,
      fv$V0,
      bodymass
    )[["profile_imb"]],
    `Probe MSS/MAC` = probe_MSS_MAC(
      distance = dist,
      MSS,
      MAC
    )[["profile_imb"]]
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(-dist, names_to = "profile")

opt_dist <- tibble(
  `Sprint Profile` = find_optimal_distance(
    MSS,
    MAC,
    optimal_func = optimal_MSS_MAC
  ),
  `FV Profile` = find_optimal_distance(
    fv$F0,
    fv$V0,
    bodymass,
    optimal_func = optimal_FV
  ),
  `FV Profile (PeakPower)` = find_optimal_distance(
    fv$F0,
    fv$V0,
    bodymass,
    optimal_func = optimal_FV,
    method = "peak"
  ),
  `Probe FV` = find_optimal_distance(
    fv$F0,
    fv$V0,
    bodymass,
    optimal_func = probe_FV
  ),
  `Probe MSS/MAC` = find_optimal_distance(
    MSS,
    MAC,
    optimal_func = probe_MSS_MAC
  )
) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 1:5, names_to = "profile")

ggplot(opt_df, aes(x = dist, y = value, color = profile)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 100, linetype = "dashed", alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(data = opt_dist, aes(x = value, y = 100), size = 2) +
  xlab("Distance (m)") +
  ylab("Profile imbalance")
```

### Creating your own data

One can use the **{shorts}}** package for simulating data by using two functions: `create_sprint_trace()` and `create_timing_gates_splits()`:

```{r}
create_sprint_trace(
  MSS = 7, MAC = 6,
  distance = c(5, 10, 20, 30, 40),
  # Add flying distance
  FD = 0.5)

create_timing_gates_splits(
  MSS = 7, MAC = 6,
  gates = c(5, 10, 20, 30, 40),
  # Add time-shift (i.e., rection time of 200ms)
  TC = 0.2)
```

Using `predict_` family of functions, one can predict kinematics and kinetics using *known* $MSS$ and $MAC$ parameters.
