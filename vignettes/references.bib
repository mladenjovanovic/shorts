  abstract = {The present study aims to assess energy demand and supply in 100-m sprint running. A mathematical model was used in which supply has two components, aerobic and anaerobic, and demand has three components, energy required to move forward (C), energy required to overcome air resistance (Caero), and energy required to change kinetic energy (Ckin). Supply and demand were equated by using assumed efficiency of converting metabolic to external work. The mathematical model uses instantaneous velocities registered by the 1997 International Association of Athletics Federations world champions at 100 m in men and women. Supply and demand components obtained in the male champion were (in J/kg) aerobic 30 (5\%), anaerobic 607 (95\%), C 400 (63\%), Caero 83 (13\%), Ckin 154 (24\%). Comparatively, a model that uses the average velocity of the male and female 100-m champions overestimates Ckin by 37 and 44\%, respectively, and underestimates Caero by 14\%. We argued that such a model is not appropriate because Ckin and Caero are nonlinear functions of velocity. Neither height nor body mass seems to have any advantage in the energetics of sprint running.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this manuscript is to describe a theoretical paradigm from which to more accurately assess linear sprinting performance. More importantly, the model describes how to interpret test results in order to pinpoint weaknesses in linear sprinting performance and design subsequent training programs. A retrospective, quasi-experimental cross sectional analysis was performed using 86 Division I female soccer and lacrosse players. Linear sprinting performance was assessed using infrared sensors at 9.14, 18.28, 27.42, and 36.58 meter distances. Cumulative (9.14, 18.28, 27.42, and 36.58 meter) and individual (1(st), 2(nd), 3(rd), and 4(th) 9.14 meter) split times were used to illustrate the theoretical paradigm. Sub-groups were identified from the sample and labelled as above average (faster), average, and below average (slower). Statistical analysis showed each sub-group was significantly different from each other (fast {$<$} average {$<$} slow). From each sub-group select individuals were identified by having a 36.58 meter time within 0.05 seconds of each other (n = 11, 13, and 7, respectively). Three phases of the sprint test were suggested to exist and called initial acceleration (0-9.14 m), middle acceleration (9.14-27.42 m), and metabolic-stiffness transition (27.42-36.58 m). A new model for assessing and interpreting linear sprinting performance was developed. Implementation of this paradigm should assist sport performance professionals identify weaknesses, minimize training errors, and maximize training adaptations. Key PointsAssessment of linear sprinting should include splits for a greater understanding of performance.Individual split times can be used to identify specific areas of weakness.Appropriate training strategies can be developed and used to improve the identified weaknesses.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to determine the accuracy of a 4 split time modelling method to generate velocity-time and velocity-distance variables in elite male 100-m sprinters and subsequently to assess the roles of key sprint parameters with respect to 100-m sprint performance. Additionally, this study aimed to assess the differences between faster and slower sprinters in key sprint variables that have not been assessed in previous work. Methods: Velocity-time and velocity-distance curves were generated using a mono-exponential function from 4 split times for 82 male sprinters during major athletics competitions. Key race variables\textemdash maximum velocity, the acceleration time constant (t), and percentage of velocity lost (vLoss)\textemdash were derived for each athlete. Athletes were divided into tertiles, based on 100-m time, with the first and third tertiles considered to be the faster and slower groups, respectively, to facilitate further analysis. Results: Modelled split times and velocities displayed excellent accuracy and close agreement with raw measures (range of mean bias was \`A0.2\% to 0.2\%, and range of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) was 0.935 to 0.999) except for 10-m time (mean bias was 1.6\% \textsection{} 1.3\%, and the ICC was 0.600). The 100-m sprint performance time and all 20-m split times had a significant near-perfect negative correlation with maximum velocity (r   \`A0.90) except for the 0 to 20-m split time, where a significantly large negative correlation was found (r = \`A0.57). The faster group had a significantly higher maximum velocity and t (p {$<$} 0.001), and no significant difference was found for vLoss (p = 0.085). Conclusion: Coaches and researchers are encouraged to utilize the 4 split time method proposed in the current study to assess several key race variables that describe a sprinter's performance capacities, which can be subsequently used to further inform training. 2095-2546/\'O 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Shanghai University of Sport.

Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data.

A total of 553 participants (333 men, 220 women) from 14 sport disciplines and all levels of practice participated in this study. Participants performed squat jumps (SJ) against multiple external loads (vertical) and linear 30\textendash 40 m sprints (horizontal). The vertical and horizontal FVP profile (i.e., theoretical maximal values of force (               F               0               ), velocity (               v               0               ), and power (               P               max               )) as well as main performance variables (unloaded SJ height in jumping and 20-m sprint time) were measured. Correlations coefficient between the same mechanical variables obtained from the vertical and horizontal modalities ranged from -0.12 to 0.58 for               F               0               , -0.31 to 0.71 for               v               0               , -0.10 to 0.67 for               P               max               , and -0.92 to -0.23 for the performance variables (i.e, SJ height and sprint time). Overall, results showed a decrease in the magnitude of the correlations for higher-level athletes. The low correlations generally observed between jumping and sprinting mechanical outputs suggest that both tasks provide distinctive information regarding the FVP profile of lower-body muscles. Therefore, we recommend the assessment of the FVP profile both in jumping and sprinting to gain a deeper insight into the maximal mechanical capacities of lower-body muscles, especially at high and elite levels.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have brought new insights into the evaluation of power-force-velocity profiles in both ballistic push-offs (eg, jumps) and sprint movements. These are major physical components of performance in many sports, and the methods the authors developed and validated are based on data that are now rather simple to obtain in field conditions (eg, body mass, jump height, sprint times, or velocity). The promising aspect of these approaches is that they allow for more individualized and accurate evaluation, monitoring, and training practices, the success of which is highly dependent on the correct collection, generation, and interpretation of athletes' mechanical outputs. The authors therefore wanted to provide a practical vade mecum to sports practitioners interested in implementing these power-force-velocity\textendash profiling approaches. After providing a summary of theoretical and practical definitions for the main variables, the authors first detail how vertical profiling can be used to manage ballistic push-off performance, with emphasis on the concept of optimal force\textendash velocity profile and the associated force\textendash velocity imbalance. Furthermore, they discuss these same concepts with regard to horizontal profiling in the management of sprinting performance. These sections are illustrated by typical examples from the authors' practice. Finally, they provide a practical and operational synthesis and outline future challenges that will help further develop these approaches.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a simple method for force\textendash velocity (F-v) profiling, based on split times, has emerged as a potential tool to examine mechanical variables underlying running sprint performance in field conditions. In this study, the reliability and concurrent validity of F-v profiling based on split times were examined when used for ice hockey skating. It was also tested how a modification of the method, in which the start instant of the sprint is estimated based on optimisation (time shift method), affects the reliability and validity of the method. Both intra- and interrater reliability were markedly improved when using the time shift method (approximately 50\% decrease in the standard error of measurement). Moreover, the results calculated using the time shift method highly correlated (r {$>$} 0.83 for all variables) with the results calculated from a continuously tracked movement of the athlete, which was considered here as the reference method. This study shows that a modification to the previously published simple method for F-v profiling improves intra- and inter-rater reliability of the method in ice hockey skating. The time shift method tested here can be used as a reliable tool to test a player's physical performance characteristic underlying sprint performance in ice hockey skating.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the impact of maximum sprint speed on peak and mean sprint speed during youth female field hockey matches. Two high-level female field hockey teams (U-17, n = 24, and U-21, n = 20) were monitored during a 4-game international test series using global position system technology and tested for maximum sprint speed. Dependent variables were compared using a 3-factor ANOVA (age group, position, and speed classification); effect sizes (Cohen               d               ) and confidence limits were also calculated. Maximum sprint speed was similar between age groups and positions, with faster players having greater speed than slower players (29.3 {$\pm$} 0.4 vs 27.2 {$\pm$} 1.1 km/h). Overall, peak match speed in youth female field hockey players reaches approximately 90\% of maximum sprint speed. Absolute peak match speed and mean sprint speed during matches were similar among the age groups (except match 1) and positions (except match 2); however, peak match speed was greater for faster players in matches 3 and 4. No differences were observed in the relative proportion for mean sprint speeds for age groups or positions, but slower players consistently displayed similar relative mean sprint speeds by using a greater proportion of their maximum sprint speed.},
